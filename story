King midas
King midas was a greedy king who always wanted wealth no matter how much he had.
One day a fairy had appeared to him and offered to grant him a wish.
He had chosen to wish for everything he touched to turn into gold
The fairy had asked him if he was sure and he replied excitedly



"Yes!" and the Fairy granted him the wish.
Midas had begun exploring the power and had proclaimed himself to be rich.
He declared a feast to celebrate his seemingly infinite wealth.
but when he touched the food, It had turned to gold!
He picked up his water but the glass turned to gold as did the water when it reached him.
His daughter had rushed to him and had ran into his arms.
but when he hugged her back,she too had turned into gold.
